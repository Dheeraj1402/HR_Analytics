# Key Insights

Attrition Trends: The attrition rate is 16.2%, indicating a significant turnover. A deeper analysis of the reasons behind this can help identify areas for improvement in employee retention.

Mid-Career Challenges: The majority of attrition occurs among employees in the 26-35 age group, highlighting a potential challenge in retaining mid-career employees. This could be due to limited growth opportunities or job satisfaction issues.

Salary-Related Attrition: A notable number of employees with salaries up to 5K are leaving, suggesting that offering competitive salaries and benefits could help in reducing attrition in this bracket.

Job Roles with High Attrition: Job roles like Sales Executive and Laboratory Technician experience higher attrition. Tailored retention strategies could be developed for these roles, such as training programs or better career progression pathways.

Gender-Based Insights: The data indicates a higher attrition rate among male employees compared to female employees. Understanding the reasons for this difference could provide valuable insights into employee experiences.

Years of Service: Employees who have been with the company for fewer years tend to leave more frequently. Strategies to engage new employees and foster a sense of belonging could help improve retention.
